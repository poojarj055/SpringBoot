   - What are native queries and when would you use them?
   - How do you perform pagination and sorting in Spring Data JPA?
   - What is the `Criteria API` and when should it be used?

### 5. **Transactions:**
   - How does Spring Data JPA handle transactions?
   - What is the role of the `@Transactional` annotation?
   - Explain the different propagation levels in Spring Data JPA.
   - How do you handle transactions with multiple databases in Spring Data JPA?

### 6. **Advanced Topics:**
   - What is the N+1 select problem and how do you avoid it?
   - How do you implement soft deletes in Spring Data JPA?
   - What is optimistic locking and how does Spring Data JPA support it?
   - How do you handle entity inheritance in Spring Data JPA?
   - Explain how to use custom converters in Spring Data JPA.

### 7. **Performance Optimization:**
   - How do you use caching in Spring Data JPA?
   - What are the common performance pitfalls in Spring Data JPA?
   - How do you use `EntityGraph` in Spring Data JPA to optimize queries?
   - How does the `@BatchSize` annotation improve performance?

### 8. **Integration:**
   - How do you integrate Spring Data JPA with Spring Boot?
   - What is the role of the `application.properties` file in configuring Spring Data JPA?
   - How do you integrate Spring Data JPA with other Spring modules like Spring Security or Spring MVC?
   - How do you test Spring Data JPA repositories?

### 9. **Error Handling:**
   - How do you handle exceptions in Spring Data JPA?
   - What are some common exceptions thrown by Spring Data JPA, and how do you handle them?
   - How do you implement custom error messages in Spring Data JPA?

### 10. **Miscellaneous:**
   - How does Spring Data JPA compare to Hibernate?
   - What is the difference between `save()` and `saveAndFlush()` in Spring Data JPA?
   - Explain the concept of auditing in Spring Data JPA.
   - How do you work with multiple data sources in Spring Data JPA?

### Example Scenario-based Questions:
   - **Scenario 1**: How would you design a repository that handles user data, ensuring that queries are optimized for large datasets?
   - **Scenario 2**: Describe how you would implement a search functionality using Spring Data JPA with criteria based on multiple fields.
   - **Scenario 3**: You need to implement a feature that logs every data change in your application. How would you achieve this using Spring Data JPA?

### Practical Coding Questions:
   - Write a Spring Data JPA repository interface that retrieves all users who registered after a certain date.
   - How would you implement a custom repository method to fetch data based on a complex query?
   - Demonstrate how you would use Spring Data JPA to perform a bulk update on a specific set of records.

### Tips:
- Be prepared to explain not just the how, but the why behind your choices in Spring Data JPA.
- Understand the underlying concepts of JPA and Hibernate, as they form the basis for Spring Data JPA.
- Practice writing and debugging JPA queries, both JPQL and native queries.
- Review common performance issues and how to address them within Spring Data JPA.

This list should help you prepare for a range of questions that could come up during an interview on Spring Data and Spring Data JPA.
